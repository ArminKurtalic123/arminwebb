		<p>Two loose-cannon narcotics cops investigate the flow of Ecstasy into Florida from a Cuban drug cartel.</p>

		<p>Eight years after the events of the first film, Miami Police Department (MPD) narcotics division detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey are investigating the flow of ecstasy into the city, leading them to a Ku Klux Klan meeting and drug drop. The subsequent raid is botched due to weak radio signals, and in the firefight wherein several Klan members are either killed or injured, Mike accidentally shoots Marcus in the buttocks. The MPD arrests the surviving Klan members, who are revealed to be mere small-time buyers and not ecstasy distributors.</p>
